## Dynamic Labels

This Directus extension provides the same functionality as the built-in "Labels" Display, except it gets the parameters (icon, colour, name) from data in a related M2O or M2M item, rather than looking up hard coded values based on the string/integer value of a column.

### How the built-in "Lables" display works

For the normal "Labels" Display, you provide parameters in the data model settings for a string/integer field like so:

```
[
  {
    "text": "Idea",
    "value": "idea",
    "icon": "lightbulb",
    "color": "#3399FF"
  },
  {
    "text": "Doing",
    "value": "doing",
    "icon": "construction",
    "color": "#FFC23B"
  },
  {
    "text": "Done",
    "value": "done",
    "icon": "check",
    "color": "#2ECDA7"
  }
]
```

This defines what kind of label to display for each `value` within the column.
For example a string field called `status` contains a `value` of

```
'doing'
```

This data is used to look up the correct parameters in the array above, which then renders the fancy label.

## How this extension works

For this extension, you provide parameters like so instead:

```
{
  "textColumn": "name",
  "iconColumn": "icon",
  "colorColumn": "colour",
  "showAsDot": false
}
```

Then a M2O field or a M2M field can use this display to render their related item from another table, such as

```
{
  "text": "Done",
  "icon": "check",
  "colour": "#2ECDA7"
}
```

You define which columns in the related table to use as props for the same label component.

To do: Show screenshot of the Table Layout displaying the single label for a M2O field, and multiple labels for a M2M field.

To do: Show how the single and multiple labels are replaced by dots if you choose the show as dots instead

# Why?

When you use this extension the label's text, icon and colour is no longer hard coded in admin settings. This means that we can use a standard table to store this data ðŸŽ‰

This really helps for multiple reasons:

- If we already have the display data in our data model, we can simply pull in the related values. There is no need to duplicate it in the admin settings.
- This data model can then be extended as usual. It doesn't die within admin settings, unable to be linked to any other tables ðŸ˜”
- The options in the list can be edited by non-admin users using the existing Directus infrastructure and permissions model.

Are there downsides?

- The options are not included within a Directus snapshot when transfered between projects. The is usually fine though as it's common though to make core data get transfered using any of the community solutions.

# Installation

Use the Directus Marketplace.

To do: Make video of how to replace the admin settings method with the dynamic labels method

# Bugs

M2M fields are buggy. There's a nasty issue that stops the labels rendering in the Table Layout when swapping collections or going to the next page of results. A refresh makes them display before you move again. The console has `[useStores]: The stores could not be found.` which is out my Directus depth right now. PR fix accepted!

# Technical notes

See `labels.vue` in the main Directus repository for where most of the code came from.
